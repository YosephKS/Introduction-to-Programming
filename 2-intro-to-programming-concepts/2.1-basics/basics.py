# Welcome to Introduction to Python Basics!

# Description:

# In this module, we will look at the overview of the
# Python programming language and some of basic programming
# concepts. This module is perfect for those who are starting
# programming and those who would like to jog their memory
# after taking some time not programming.

# 1. Printing Text
print("Hello World")    # By running this instruction, "Hello World" will appear in the terminal

# 2. Using Comments
# The symbol in front of this line is a comment.
# Every script after this symbol will be skipped by the computer.
# However, it is useful to have this as a part of documentation for
# both the authors and other contributors

# 3. Python as Calculator
x = 3   # Defining variables (save values)
X = 2   # Python is case-sensitive, so different case implies different variables

# Using mathematical operation
y = x + X # y = 5 (Defining a new variable)

x = 4   # With this instruction, x value is overwritten to 4
        # Nevertheless, it does not affect the value of y

# There are two types of fundamental mathemtaical operations that can be used in Python

# Unary Operators
p = +2      # positive
q = -2      # negative

# Binary Operators
a = 3 + 2   # addition
b = 3 - 2   # substraction
c = 3 * 2   # multiplication
d = 3 / 2   # division
e = 3 ** 2  # power

# These operations follow the rules of mathematical operation
# Example
f = (1 + 1) ** 2 * 3 # f = 2 ** 2 * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12
